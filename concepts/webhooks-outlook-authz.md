# Maintaining continous notification delivery for Outlook resources by responding to authorization challenges

An app that subscribes to notifications for Outlook resources, such as messages or events, needs to be able to respond to authorization challenges in order to maintain continous flow of notifications over the lifetime of its subscription.

There are certain events in the Outlook service that cause the notifications to stop flowing to the subscribing app, until the app re-authorizes its subscription. Examples include:

- user's password has been reset
- user's device is out of compliance
-	user's account has been revoked

When these events occur, Microsoft Graph will send a special lifecycle notification - an authorization challenge - to the app. The app needs to respond to that notification by re-authorizing its subscription.

An app needs to implement logic additional to the standard [notification pattern](webhooks.md):
- Register a separate lifecycle notification url to receive authorization challenges
- Identify these challenges, and respond to them by calling a specific API in Microsoft Graph; 

The Outlook service may also send special lifecycle notifications if some notifications could not be delivered to the app. An app should handle those special notifications by re-syncing resource data using Microsoft Graph.

## Creating a subscription

When creating a subscription, a separate notification endpoint needs to be specified, using the `lifecycleNotificationUrl` property; this is where the authorization challenges will be delivered. If the property is not set, the challenges will not be sent, and the subscription's notifications might stop flowing without notice.

> **Note:** At the moment, the `lifecycleNotificationUrl` property can only be set or read using the `beta` version of Graph APIs. However, subscriptions created using `beta` are stored in the same production environment as `v1.0` so you can implement the new Outlook flow described here in addition to your regular usage of `v1.0` with other subscriptions.

#### Subscription request example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "changeType": "created,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/lifecycleNotifications",
  "resource": "/users/{id}/messages",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-03-20T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "<secretClientState>"
}
```
 
> **Important:** Both notifications URLs must share the same hostname. 

> **Note:** Both notification endpoints will need to be validated by the client app, as described in [the generic notification article](webhooks.md#managing-subscriptions).
You may choose to use the same URL for both endpoints, in which case you will receive two validation requests, to which you will need to respond.

## Migrating existing subscriptions

If the app has existing subscriptions, it will continue to receive resource data notifications as before, but it will not receive any lifecycle notifications. To subscribe to subscription lifecycle notifications, an app will have to replace the older subscriptions with new subscriptions that include the `lifecycleNotificationUrl`. It is not possible to update (`PATCH`) the existing subscriptions to include the `lifecycleNotificationUrl`.

## Responding to authorization challenges

These lifecycle notifications inform the app that a subscription must be re-authorized to maintain the flow of data. 

An app can create a long lived subscription (e.g. 3 days), and resource data notifications will start flowing to the `notificationUrl`. However, the conditions of access to the resource data may change over time. For example, an event in the Outlook service may occur that requires the app to re-authorize. In such a case, the flow looks as follows:

1. Outlook decides that a subscription requires re-authorization from the app, to maintain the resource data flow.
    1. There is no set cadence for these events. They may occur frequently for some resources, and almost never for others.

2. Microsoft Graph sends an authorization challenge notification to the `lifecycleNotificationUrl`

3. The app responds to the challenge. It has two options:
    1. Re-authorize the subscription; this does not extend the subscription's expiry date.
    2. Renew the subscription; this both re-authorizes and extends the expiry date.

  Note: Each of the above actions require the app to present a valid authentication token, similar to the one used when creating or renewing the subscription.

4. If the app succeeds in responding to the challenge, resource notifications are resumed. However, if the app fails (for example, it could not obtain a valid authentication token), resource notifications will not be sent.

### Authorization challenge notification example

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "subscriptionId":"<subscription_guid>",
      "subscriptionExpirationDateTime":"2019-03-20T11:00:00.0000000Z",
      "tenantId": "<tenant_guid>",
      "clientState":"<secretClientState>",
      "lifecycleEvent": "reauthorizationRequired"
    }
  ]
}
```

A few things to note about this type of notification:
- The `"lifecycleEvent": "reauthorizationRequired"` field designates this notification as an authorization challenge.
- The notification does not contain any information about a specific resource, because it is not related to a resource change, but to the subscription state change
- `value` is an array, so multiple authorization challenges may be batched together, the same as for resource notifications. You should process each notification in the batch, and react to it.

### Action to take

1. [Acknowledge](webhooks.md#notifications) the receipt of the notification, by responding to the POST call with `202 - Accepted`.
2. [Validate](webhooks.md#notifications) the authenticity of the notification.
3. Ensure the app has a valid authentication token to take the next step. 
> **Note:** If you are using one of the [authentication libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries) they will handle this for you by either reusing a valid cached token, or obtaining a new token. Note that obtaining a new token may fail, since the conditions of access may have changed, and the caller may no longer be allowed access to the resource data.

4. To re-authorize the subscription perform a regular renewal action:
```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-03-22T11:00:00.0000000Z",
}
```
> **Note:** This action may fail, because the authorization checks performed by the system may deny the app or the user access to the resource. It may be necessary for the app to obtain a new authentication token from the user to successfully reauthorize a subscription.
You may retry these actions later, at any time, without having to wait for another authorization challenge, for example when the conditions of access have change. 
Note that any resource changes in the time period from when the authorization challenge was sent, to when the app re-authorizes the subscription successfully, will be lost. The app will need to fetch those changes on its own.

5. Perform a data resync to identify changes that were not delivered as notifications. 
  
    You can perform this data resync by using the last known time you received a notification for this resource. For example, while listening to notifications for new messages on an user's mailbox, you can use the following query to fetch the list of messages that were missed: `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{id}/messages?$filter=createdDateTime+ge+{LastTimeNotificationWasReceived}`

## Responding to data re-sync notifications

These signals inform the app that some notifications may have not been delivered. You should decide if your app ignores or handles these signals.

### Notification example

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "subscriptionId":"<subscription_guid>",
      "subscriptionExpirationDateTime":"2019-03-20T11:00:00.0000000Z",
      "tenantId": "<tenant_guid>",
      "clientState":"<secretClientState>",
      "lifecycleEvent": "dataResyncRequired"
    }
  ]
}
```

A few things to note about this type of notification:
- The `"lifecycleEvent": "dataResyncRequired"` field designates this as a signal about missed notifications.
- The notification does not contain any information about a specific resource, because it is not related to a resource change, but to the subscription state.
- `value` is an array, so multiple signals may be batched together, the same as for resource notifications. You should process each notification in the batch, and react to it.

### Action to take

1. [Acknowledge](webhooks.md#notifications) the receipt of the notification, by responding to the POST call with `202 - Accepted`.
  - If you ignore these, signals, do nothing else. Otherwise:
2. [Validate](webhooks.md#notifications) the authenticity of the notification.

3. Perform a full data resync of the resource to identify the changes that were not delivered. 


## Future-proof the code handling lifecycle notifications

In the future Graph will add more types of subscription lifecycle notifications. They will be posted to the same endpoint: `lifecycleNotificationUrl`, but they will have a different value under `lifecycleEvent` and may contain a slightly different schema and properties, specific to the scenario for which they will be issued.

You should implement your code in a future-proof way so it does not break when Graph introduces new types of lifecycle notifications. We recommend the following approach:

1. Explicitly identify each notification as an event that you support, using the `lifecycleEvent` property. For example, look for the `"lifecycleEvent": "reauthorizationRequired"` propety to identify an authorization challenge, and handle it.

2. For any lifecycle events you do not recognize, ignore them; we may add more values for the `lifecycleEvent` property in the future. We advise you log them so you can become aware of the new types of signals, in case you missed a Graph announcement for the new scenario. That way you can look up the updated documentation and implement your support for it at your discretion.
